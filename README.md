# Task 4: Dashboard Design

## Overview
This is the fourth task of my internship, focused on designing an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders using the `superstore_dataset2011-2015.csv` dataset (sourced from Kaggle). The dashboard was built using Power BI, following the guidelines provided:
- **Objective**: Design an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders.
- **Tools**: Power BI.
- **Deliverables**: Interactive dashboard + PPT summary.

The dashboard includes:
- Cards for summary metrics (Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Profit Margin %, Sales Growth %).
- Slicers for Region, Category, and Year.
- Visualizations for Sales (by Category), Profit (by Region), Growth (by Category), and time-series trends (Sales and Profit over time).

## Files
- `SalesDashboard.pbix`: The Power BI dashboard file (open in Power BI Desktop for interactivity).
- `Superstore_Sales_Dashboard_Presentation.pptx`: The PPT summary with key insights and recommendations.
- `superstore_dataset2011-2015.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis (sourced from Kaggle).
- `Screenshots/`: Screenshots of the dashboard for quick viewing:

## Key Insights
- **Sales**: Technology category has the highest sales (~$800K over 2011-2014).
- **Profit**: APAC region has the highest profit (~$150K), driven by Technology sales.
- **Growth**: Furniture category shows the highest sales growth (15% YoY from 2013 to 2014).
- **Trends**: Sales and profit peak in December each year due to holiday demand.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts on Technology products in the APAC region.
- Invest in Furniture products to capitalize on their growth potential.
- Monitor seasonal trends (e.g., December peaks) to adjust inventory and promotions.

## How to View
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Open `SalesDashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to interact with the dashboard.
- **PPT Summary**: View `Superstore_Sales_Dashboard_Presentation.pptx` for key insights and recommendations.
- **Dataset**: Use `superstore_dataset2011-2015.csv` to reproduce the analysis.
